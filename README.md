## Project Background

This project started as an experiment exploring AI-assisted development workflows to accelerate early prototyping.

AI was used to speed up initial scaffolding and exploration. The architecture, structure, and ongoing development are designed, reviewed, and refactored manually.

The goal is to evolve this into a production-quality, maintainable application.
